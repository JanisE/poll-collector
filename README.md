# Poll Collector

Collects responses from multiple (multi-question) polls considered as one continuous poll (all the parts being presented simultaneously), and outputs the voters sorted by the count of correct answers and time.

(TODO: Collects responses from multiple one-question polls and outputs the voters sorted by correct answers and time.)

The distributable tool consists of only one file: `poll_collector.html` (which loads public JS libraries).


# How To

1. Open `poll_collector.html` in a web browser (tested on Chrome and Firefox).
2. Drag and drop all the XLSX poll exported files onto the file drop area.
3. Mark the correct answers. The top voter list is automatically refreshed.
